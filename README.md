# DIY Air Quality Monitor & Datalogger: PM1-10, VOC, NOx, CO2

This repository contains the **Arduino code** and the **optional CAD design files** to build the V1 version of the DIY Air Quality Monitor & Datalogger described in this series of posts:
* Part 1 - **Introduction**: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2024/08/diy-pm-voc-air-quality-monitor-with.html
* Part 2 - **Implementation**:      _in the works (describes the files uploaded here)_
* Part 3 - **Results**:  _a month away_

Part 2 describes how to put together and run this project --> start there to make sense of the files in this repository.

Expectations for code updates: V1 is 95% core-features complete at this time (Aug'24). The remaining TODOs are listed in the 1st lines of code. Weekly-ish updates will be committed over the next 3 to 6 months (mostly code cleanup & non-essential features). Focus should then shift to V2 (wireless sensors).

Happy coding & clean air to all !

Warning: _I am by no means a pro SW developer. Which explains the bloated, unstructured, confusing, giant single-file piece of spaghetti Arduino/C/C++ code that runs this monitor. Good luck to anyone trying to mod anything... Submit a github issue if you have questions or feature requests._
