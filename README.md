# DIY Air Quality Monitor & Datalogger: PM1-10, VOC, NOx, CO2, TÂ°, RH%

This repository contains the **Arduino code** and the **optional CAD design files** to build the V1 version of the DIY Air Quality Monitor & Datalogger described in this series of posts:
* Part 1 - **Introduction**: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2024/08/diy-pm-voc-air-quality-monitor-with.html
* Part 2 - **Implementation**: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2024/08/diy-air-quality-monitor-datalogger-part.html
* Part 3 - **Results**:  _a month away_

Part 2 describes how to put together and run this project --> start there to make sense of the files in this repository.

Expectations for code updates: V0.8 is 80% core-features complete at this time (Aug'24). Feature planning is listed in the top lines of code. Weekly-ish updates will be committed over the next 3 to 6 months. Focus should then shift to V2 (wireless sensors).

Happy coding & clean air to all !

Warning: _I am by no means a pro SW developer. Which explains the bloated, confusing, giant single-file piece of Arduino/C/C++ spaghetti code that runs this monitor. Good luck to anyone touching this... Submit a github issue if you have questions or feature requests._
